# LLMs Are Fluent, Confident, and **Totally Wrong**

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/llm-contracts)](https://pypi.org/project/llm-contracts/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Until Now.

**llm-contracts** is the first developer-first framework for validating, linting, and asserting the correctness of LLM-generated outputs. Think of it as **ESLint + Pytest for AI responses** — without requiring a specific model or cloud API.

## The Problem That Keeps You Up At Night

> **You deployed an AI feature last week. It's working perfectly.**  
> **Except when it confidently tells customers about warranty policies that don't exist.**  
> **Or invents product specifications.**  
> **Or promises shipping to countries you don't serve.**

**Sound familiar?**

### Real-World AI Failures:
- **Air Canada's chatbot** promised non-existent bereavement fares → Legal action
- **CNET's AI writer** published financial advice with wrong interest rates → Public corrections
- **ChatGPT lawyer** submitted fake legal citations in court → Professional sanctions
- **E-commerce AI** invented product features that didn't exist → Customer complaints

**The pattern:** LLMs generate responses that **look perfect** but **break everything.**

---

## The Solution: Contracts for AI Output

Instead of hoping your AI "gets it right," **llm-contracts** lets you define exactly what "right" looks like:

```yaml
# Your contract with the AI
schema:
  warranty_period:
    type: str
    pattern: "^(30|90|365) days?$"  # Only valid warranty periods
  
rules:
  - keyword_must_include: ["warranty", "return policy"]
  - keyword_must_not_include: ["guaranteed", "always", "never"]
  - no_placeholder_text: "\\[INSERT_.*\\]"
  - word_count_min: 100
  - phrase_proximity:
      terms: ["warranty", "30 days"]
      max_distance: 20  # Warranty details must be close together
```

**Result:** Every AI response gets validated before reaching your users. **No more silent failures.**

## See It In Action

### **Before llm-contracts:**
```json
{
  "product_description": "[INSERT_PRODUCT_NAME] is the best quality item you'll ever buy! We guarantee 100% satisfaction always and forever. Our unlimited warranty covers everything!"
}
```
*Passes the "looks good" test. Breaks everything else.*

### **After llm-contracts:**
```yaml
Schema validation: PASSED
Placeholder text detected: "[INSERT_PRODUCT_NAME]"
Forbidden keywords: "guarantee", "always", "unlimited"
Missing required: "30-day warranty", "return policy"

VALIDATION FAILED - Output rejected
```
*Catches the problems **before** they reach production.*

## Why Developers Choose llm-contracts

### **Framework-Agnostic**
Works with **any LLM** (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) and **any framework** (LangChain, direct API calls, custom implementations).

### **Production-Ready**
Built by developers who've shipped AI features at scale. Handles edge cases, provides detailed error reporting, and integrates with your existing CI/CD.

### **Zero Vendor Lock-in**
No API calls to external services. No model-specific prompting tricks. Just pure validation logic that runs anywhere Python runs.

### **Professional Reports**
Generate beautiful HTML and Markdown validation reports for stakeholders, compliance, and debugging.

## How Is This Different?

**Validate AI like you validate code — enforce rules, not hope for the best.**

| Tool | Approach | llm-contracts Difference |
|------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Guardrails** | Tries to fix bad output | We **fail fast** — no magic repairs |
| **LangChain** | Orchestrates AI pipelines | We're a **QA layer**, not orchestration |
| **Pydantic** | Python type validation | We validate **content quality**, not just types |
| **Manual Review** | Human checks everything | We **automate validation** at machine speed |

> **Other tools try to fix LLM output.**  
> **llm-contracts asks:** "Did the AI follow the rules?"  
> **If not, we fail it — no excuses.**

### Installation
```bash
pip install llm-contracts
```

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Validate AI output against your rules
llm-validate output.json --schema schema.yaml --html-report report.html
