# Roadmap

Our vision is to make llm-contracts the **industry standard** for LLM output validation. Here's what we're building next:

---

## **Version 1.0.0** - *Released July 2025* ðŸŽ‰

### **Core Foundation - COMPLETED**
- **Schema-Based Validation** - Complete structure and type validation
- **Text Linting Rules** - Content quality checks (keywords, patterns, word count, tone)
- **Professional Reports** - HTML and Markdown generation with detailed results
- **CLI Interface** - Command-line validation and reporting tools
- **Python SDK** - Programmatic API for integration
- **Web Frontend** - Interactive validation interface
- **PyPI Distribution** - Easy installation via `pip install llm-contracts`
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - GitHub Pages site with examples and guides

---

## **Version 1.1.0** - *Q4 2025*

### **Enhanced Contract Types**
- **PII Detection** - Automatically detect and flag personally identifiable information
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Validate emotional tone and brand compliance
- **Toxicity Filtering** - Block harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content
- **Fact Checking** - Cross-reference claims against knowledge bases
- **Language Detection** - Ensure output is in the expected language

### **Smart Retry Logic**
- **Automatic Retry** - Configurable retry attempts for failed validations
- **Progressive Backoff** - Intelligent retry timing to avoid rate limits
- **Fallback Strategies** - Use alternative models when primary fails
- **Circuit Breaker** - Prevent cascade failures in production systems

---

## **Version 1.2.0** - *Q1 2026*

### **Framework Integrations**
- **LangChain Integration** - Native llm-contracts validator for LangChain pipelines
- **FastAPI Plugin** - Automatic validation middleware for FastAPI applications
- **Flask Extension** - Easy integration with Flask web applications
- **Django Integration** - Model validators and middleware for Django projects
- **Streamlit Components** - UI components for Streamlit AI applications

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Async Validation** - Non-blocking validation for high-throughput applications
- **Batch Processing** - Validate multiple outputs simultaneously
- **Caching Layer** - Cache validation results for repeated patterns
- **Memory Optimization** - Reduced memory footprint for large-scale deployments

---

## **Version 1.3.0** - *Q2 2026*

### **Enterprise Features**
- **Multi-tenancy** - Separate validation rules and reporting for different teams/clients
- **Role-based Access** - Fine-grained permissions for validation rules and reports
- **Audit Trail** - Complete history of validation results and rule changes
- **SLA Monitoring** - Track validation performance and reliability metrics

### **Advanced Output Formats**
- **JSON Schema Export** - Convert validation rules to JSON Schema format
- **OpenAPI Integration** - Generate API documentation with validation constraints
- **PDF Reports** - Professional PDF validation reports for compliance
- **CSV/Excel Export** - Tabular data export for analysis and reporting

---

## **Version 1.4.0** - *Q3 2026*

### **Cloud Integrations**

- **Jenkins Plugin** - Jenkins build step for validation
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Validate AI outputs before code commits

---

## **Version 1.5.0** - *Q4 2026*

### **Visual Schema Builder 2.0**
