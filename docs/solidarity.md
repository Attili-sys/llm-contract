# Solidarity with Palestine

As developers, we build tools and infrastructure — but we don't live outside the world we build in.

This page is a small but intentional statement of solidarity with the people of Palestine, particularly those in Gaza, who continue to endure occupation, siege, and unimaginable human suffering.

## Why this is here

I believe ethical responsibility doesn't stop at code.  
What we choose to say — or not say — reflects what we accept.

This statement will remain part of this project as long as the injustice persists.

## I stand for:

- The right to life, safety, and dignity
- Freedom from occupation and displacement
- Truth over silence
- Humanity over neutrality

## The Connection to Our Work

Just as `llm-contracts` validates AI outputs for truth and accuracy, we must validate our own moral positions. 

Technology is not neutral. The tools we build, the platforms we choose, and the voices we amplify all have consequences.

## Resources to Learn and Support

## For Contributors

Contributors to this project are welcome regardless of their personal views on this conflict. We ask only for:

- Respect for human dignity and life
- Commitment to truth and factual accuracy
- Understanding that some issues transcend politics

## A Personal Note

This stance reflects my personal conviction as the creator of this project. I understand it may be controversial, but I believe that staying silent in the face of injustice is itself a choice.

If you find value in `llm-contracts` as a tool, I hope you'll also consider the values that drive its creation.
