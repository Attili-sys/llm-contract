# Ethics and Values

## Our Stance

As developers, we build tools and infrastructure — but we don't live outside the world we build in.

This document is a statement of the ethical principles that guide this project and its maintainers.

## Solidarity with Palestine

I stand in full solidarity with the people of Palestine, particularly those in Gaza, who continue to endure occupation, siege, and unimaginable human suffering.

### Why this is here

I believe ethical responsibility doesn't stop at code.  
What we choose to say — or not say — reflects what we accept.

This statement will remain part of this project as long as the injustice persists.

### I stand for:

- The right to life, safety, and dignity
- Freedom from occupation and displacement
- Truth over silence
- Humanity over neutrality

## Core Values

### Humanity First
Technology should serve human dignity and well-being. We reject the use of our tools for surveillance, oppression, or harm.

### Truth and Transparency
Just as `llm-contracts` validates AI outputs for accuracy, we commit to truth in our communications and transparency in our actions.

### Justice and Equity
We believe in equal rights and dignity for all people, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, religion, or background.

### Developer Responsibility
With the privilege of building technology comes responsibility for its impact on the world.
